			<h1>Requirements</h1>
			<div class="line"></div>
			The first step in our project, as with any, was requirements gathering.
			All we had to start off with to gather requirements were [this document]
			We compiled a list of these requirements, but that list was quite short.
			We knew we had to come up with a more detailed list.
			This was initially done by asking questions with our sponsor to try to clarify things.
			We got together a much more extensive list, however, there was still some ambiguity and clarification needed.
			We decided that imagery would be most useful as it can depict a bit more than just words, and we
			understood our sponsor was keen on design as well.
			We drew up a few wireframes very early on to try to map out the flow and design of the system.
			We presented this to Bizcloud as a talking point and this allowed us to discuss how we imagined the system
			would work vs what Bizcloud was thinking about it.
