			The original specifications disclosed to us are listed [here].
			<br> The <b>E-Bulletin</b> is a Smart TV app developed to display QR codes that take you to external pages, as well as a brief description of them.
			The idea is that users can walk up to the TV, see a post-it note- like display, and if the content shown interests them, they can scan the QR code and get more information about it. 
			<br>The <b>Interactive Kiosk</b> is a web app interface to manage the Administrators, devices and content as well as where the content is displayed.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The TVs as well as the content to be displayed on them are grouped into domains called Client Accounts.
			The Client Accounts are owned by an organization who would contact Bizcloud to set up their account.
			Once this account is created, they can manage Administrators, content and devices within their Client Account.
			End users are able to submit requests to put their content on the E-Bulletin via the web app.
			Administrators can then approve or deny these requests.
			The Administrators can also generate their own content to be displayed on the E-Bulletins.
			Administrators can also add devices.
			Through the Smart TV, they can send a request to register the TV to the Client Account.
			The request is then displayed in the Web App.
			Once this is approved, it is added to the system and content can be pushed to it.
