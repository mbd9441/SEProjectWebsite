	<h1>Other Metrics</h1>

	Originally for the Fall semester, we settled on the metrics given in the Original Proposal found [here] <br>
	We didn't keep consistent track of these metrics and much of our metrics ended up just being based on effort by the time our presentation came around. <br>
	Once we rolled into the Spring Semester, we had our metrics solidified and continued to track them throughout the semester in order to plan our sprints.
