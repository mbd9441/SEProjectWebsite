				The Smart TV App component of the system was an integral part of the requirements presented by Bizcloud Experts.
				It serves as a virtual bulletin board - a place for different people to post information to a group of people.
				This could include job offerings, lost and found, apartments for rent and the like.
				Each piece of information displayed on the Smart TV App is supposed to be essentially a short blurb about something.
				Think of it like digital post-it notes.
				Each post-it note is also accompanied by a QR code.
				This is to take the user to an external link, providing more information about the information displayed on the post-it note.
