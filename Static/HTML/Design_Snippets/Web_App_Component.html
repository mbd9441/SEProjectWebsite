			One of the requirements for the project was a dashboard to be able to manage the content on the E-Bulletin
			from anywhere at any time. This assumedly included mobile devices. We also wanted to make sure our front-end
			was decoupled from the back-end since we already had to use the cloud. To cover this criteria, we 
			opted for a web-app style website run on a flexible framework. We decided to use Angular to build out our
			web app funcionality.
