<h1>Process</h1>

Our process changed and evolved as we progressed through our Senior Project.
<h1>Fall Semester</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
When we first began our project, we admittedly didn't develop a well thought-out process.
We began by simply using the weekly Four-Up charts to plan and keep track of what was done each week.
Eventually the need for more planning and progress tracking to ensure we were meeting deadlines arose.
It was then we decided to implement a Gantt-chart style schedule to map out the rest of the semester.
This showed us a better break-down of the future, but didn;t allow us to track what work was actually done and when.
Enter Trello, our first card-based attempt to track our progress.
We integrated Trello into our Slack channel to keep track of card progress, and our Project Manager was upkeeping the cards.
Unfortunately due to the late adoption along with the cumbersome nature of the system led to an extreme underutilization of the tool.
In fact, the notifications through Slack were nearly silenced by the entire team because of how frequent they were.
It was also in a whole extra location as opposed to the other tools we were using.
This decentralization led us to attempt to use Github Projects to do essentially the same thing.
Around halfway through the semester, we decided to use two-week Sprints. We then used the cards to keep track of our progress.
Ultimately our lack of a pre-established process made the upkeep of our project management futile.
We did not end up meeting all of our First Semester goals, but learned a lot about Project Management along the way.
