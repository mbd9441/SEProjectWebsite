<h1>Spring Semester</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
	Our Winter Break along with the first week or so of the Spring Semester involved a lot of project planning and searching for process solutions.
	The first thing we instated were daily stand-ups. After reviewing other team's use of Slack to perform these, we afreed the idea would prove useful.
	Next, we looked in to Redmine for our project management tool.
	Bizcloud uses this internally, so we requested access to it and figured if we needed help, we had the support to back it up.
	We were met with many permissions issues blocking our progress forward.
	We quickly scrapped this idea in favor of Jira.
	Members of our team had used it before, so it was much more familiar and it ended up being more user-friendly with a lot more features and accessiblity.
	One of our team members got a free trial and decided to host an instance of Jira on his personal machine.
	Once our tool was finally settled, planning commenced.
	The rest of the semester was roughly mapped out in to sprints and tasks that had to get done along with due dates.
	This new utility along with a revamped process and restructuring of our Team Roles led to increasingly productive sprints.
