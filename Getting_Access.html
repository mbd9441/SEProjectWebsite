			<h2>Bizcloud Project Website</h2>
			<div class="line"></div>
			The Bizcloud Project Website was a Google Site Bizcloud created for us to maintain throughout the project.
			Any sort of deliverables that might interest them would be put on this website.
			Often if we requested they review a document, it was implied that we embed it on the Google Site for them to be able to view
			along with emailing a link to the document in our Drive for optimum visibility.
			<br>
			<br>
			To get access, you can send a request to view it to Nagesh's email.
			<h2>Github Repo</h2>
			<div class="line"></div>
			Our Github Repository was created by Bizcloud prior to our work on the project.
			They forked their repository and this is where we began developing.
			Their repository consists of 4 sub-Repositories:
			<ul>
			  <li>ikFrontEnd</li>
			  <li>ikBackEnd</li>
			  <li>InfoKiosk</li>
			  <li>ikInfraAsCode</li>
			</ul>
			To get access, you can send a request to view it to Nagesh's email.
